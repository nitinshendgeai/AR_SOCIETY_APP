### fix: resolve WingModel floor creation serialization issue

- **File:** `mobile/lib/features/society_structure/presentation/screens/floor_list_screen.dart`
- **Change:** Add Floor button now passes `extra: {'wing': wing, 'floor': null}` instead of `extra: wing` to match the GoRouter `floorForm` builder contract (`Map<String, dynamic>`).
- **Impact:** Eliminates `TypeError: Instance of 'WingModel' is not a subtype of type 'Map<String,dynamic>'` crash on the Floors screen.

### fix: resolve Flutter web registration connectivity issue

- Token storage is now platform-aware: `SharedPreferences` (localStorage) on web, `FlutterSecureStorage` on native, via `kIsWeb` guard in `token_storage.dart`.
- Fixes `OperationError` from Web Crypto AES-GCM on Chrome localhost.

### fix: resolve Flutter startup asset and env configuration issues

- GoRouter now created once via `_RouterNotifier + refreshListenable`; no longer recreated on auth state changes.
- `AuthLoading` state no longer redirects to splash (allows login to complete without nav stack reset).

### fix: resolve onboarding user authentication issue

- `RegistrationResult` and `TrialSuccessScreen` updated to show all 9 onboarding credentials, Society Code badge, Copy All, Sign in as Admin button.

### fix: parse roles from flat API list instead of nested user_roles

- `UserOut.from_orm_with_roles()` reads roles from `user.user_roles` relationship.
- `GET /users/` now returns only users belonging to the authenticated admin's society.

### security: enforce multi-tenant user isolation

- Added `society_id` FK to `users` table via Alembic migration `b1c2d3e4f5a6`.
- All user repository/service/route methods now filter by `society_id`.
- Backfill migration assigns `society_id` to existing users via email domain pattern matching.

### fix: GET /api/v1/societies/ 500 Internal Server Error

- Changed `SocietyOut.trial_start_date` and `trial_end_date` from `Optional[str]` to `Optional[date]` in `backend/app/schemas/society.py`.
- Root cause: Pydantic v2 does not coerce `datetime.date` → `str` in lax mode; FastAPI 500 before CORS headers made it appear as a CORS error.

### feat: redesign dashboard with operational summary cards

- **File:** `mobile/lib/features/dashboard/role_dashboards.dart`
- **Change:** Reworked the dashboard from large module tiles into a compact operational layout with:
  - welcome card showing society name, user name, role, and current date
  - responsive summary cards for occupancy, residents, staff, visitors, complaints, approvals, and notices
  - operational panels for complaints, visitors, and staff duty
  - compact quick actions for frequent tasks
  - drawer-based navigation instead of menu-style landing tiles
- **Impact:** Better mobile and web responsiveness, cleaner operational dashboard, and role-aware overview screens for admins, committee, security, and residents.
